![Screenshot](fireredultra-box-art.jpg)

Based on the pokefirered disassembly with Pokeemerald Expansion Updates from [**cawtds**](https://github.com/cawtds/pokefirered-expansion)

# Features

- **Reusable TMs**

- **Forgettable HMs** Without a Move Tutor.

- **Startup Money** Startup money has been changed from 3,000 to 35,000 Pokedollars.

- **HGSS Pokedex Plus** Backported from HeartGold SoulSilver, you get to enjoy the features of Pokedex Plus.

- **Follower Pokemon** Any Pokemon in the first party slot will follow you through the overworld.

- **Trade Evolutions** All Trade Evolutions can evolve by using either a Linking Cable or their specific evolution items like Metal Coat or King's Rock, but can also evolve by trading between FR and LG out of the box.

- **Debug Menu** By pressing R+Start you can open a special debug menu made by a few people. [**See here**](/include/config/debug.h) and it includes features like giving you items, pokemon, and other changes to the game.

- **Double Battles** All double battles no longer require you to have two pokemon in your party and 25% of the time wild battles will be double.  This also means that you can battle two trainers at once.

- **Gen 5 Map Area Popups** All Map Area Popups are switched to Gen 5 and include a 12hr clock displayed at the bottom.

- **Gen 6 Exp. Share** From the beginning, you can add the Exp. Share from the Debug menu to share Experience points with your party.

- **Running Indoors** This makes traversing all of Kanto much easier and faster, great for speed runs.

- **Fast-Run** During wild battles you can hold B to run.

- **Known Issues** The game is known to crash here and there during battle, this is most likely due to the codebase being under development still.  It's based on Emerald Expansion.  Save often.  Still testing this to find any crashes.  See [**Issue 1**](https://github.com/mlastes1987/FireRedUltra/issues/1)
